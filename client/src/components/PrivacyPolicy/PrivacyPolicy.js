          In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are

          research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better
          understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled
          and analyzed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the

          not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Website or
          not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.
